  <h1>CP1406/CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Name: Shi Zonglin</strong></p>
  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>Within 3 months, increase the number of new customer email appointments for 100SMILES Dental Care via the website by 20%, 
    reduce the proportion of consultation calls by 30%, and enhance the brand awareness of the dental clinic in the Razole community.</p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p>Track the number of appointments submitted via the "Email Appointment" feature within 3 months after the website goes live.
    Record the usage count of the "20% Discount for First Visit" campaign.
    Monitor the volume of inquiry emails sent from the "Annual Physical Examination Package" page.</p>
  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>Plan 1:
     Add a "Pediatric Dentistry" quick access at the top of the homepage, 
     use soft light blue/pink color schemes paired with pediatric dentistry scene images, 
     and simplify the "family package appointment" process.
    Plan 2:
    Enlarge the page font to 16px, increase the contrast between text and background, 
    fix the emergency contact number (07 5000 5599) in the sidebar, 
    and highlight Dr. Benedict Sloan's dental implant experience on the "Doctor Team" page.</p>
  <h2>Site Flowchart</h2>
  <p>use https://app.diagrams.net/ to draw a graph
    page structure is looks like: index.html-services.html-ourteam.html-contact.html-promotions.html-articles.html
    save the graph as .png
